# Changelog

Release notes are generated from commits and published on the
[releases page](https://github.com/aramase/agentsessions/releases). This file records what a reader
needs to know beyond a commit list: what a release means for compatibility, and what it does not
provide.

## Unreleased

### Compatibility

- Placement supports `WithIncarnationDialer` for transport routing from the complete backend-provided
  incarnation, before the Placer stamps its new fence. A non-nil callback takes precedence over
  `WithDialer` regardless of option order; nil preserves address-based dialing. Existing `Dialer`,
  `WithDialer`, and default transports are unchanged.
- Every new execution records `EXECUTION_START`, including default-config turns, so interrupted
  recovery can reject partially committed inputs. Binaries older than this release fail chain
  verification with a `content_hash` mismatch for sessions containing this event. Rollback is not
  supported for any session that executed a turn on this release, including existing markerless
  sessions that execute another turn after upgrading. No SQLite schema migration or log rewrite is
  required. Replay streams and harness `History` now carry one extra `EXECUTION_START` event per
  turn (in `History`, only prior turns).
- `ForkRequest.identity` is now rejected with `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, including an empty identity
  message, because per-child principals are not enforced. v0.1.0–v0.1.2 accepted this field,
  stored it on the child, and returned it from `GetSession` and `ListSessions`; callers must now
  omit it to fork. `Session.identity` on `CreateSession` remains recorded provenance, not
  authorization, and is unchanged.

## v0.1.2

A patch release. No API change; it exists because the v0.1.1 images were unusable.

### Fixed

- Container images are published under the documented names. v0.1.1 pushed them as
  `agentsessionsd-<md5>` and `harnessnode-<md5>`, because ko derives a repository from the Go import
  path and appends a hash unless told not to, so every name in the README and release notes returned
  404.
- Image tags carry the `v` prefix, matching the git tag and the release archives, so one string
  identifies a release everywhere.

## v0.1.1

A patch release. No API change; the reason to take it is the toolchain and the images.

### Security

- Built with Go 1.26.6. The v0.1.0 binaries were built with 1.26.0, which carries 23 reachable
  standard-library vulnerabilities including TLS, x509, and asn1 issues. Both modules now pin a
  toolchain floor so a release cannot ship an unpatched runtime again.
- gRPC 1.83.2, fixing two reachable denial-of-service vulnerabilities against a gRPC server
  (`GO-2026-6443`, `GO-2026-6348`).

### Added

- Container images, so a deployment no longer has to build its own:
  `ghcr.io/aramase/agentsessions/agentsessionsd` and `.../harnessnode`. Multi-arch, built with ko
  from the tagged source, each with an SBOM. The server runs as uid 65532.
- `golangci-lint` and `govulncheck` gate every change, on both modules.

### Fixed

- A failed `Serve` in the embedded CLI server and the local runtime backend discarded its error,
  leaving a dead server that surfaced later as a confusing client dial failure.
- The substrate manifests named a `ko://` placeholder that only the conformance workflow could
  resolve; they now name the published image and apply as written.
- Release notes link each commit. A bare 40-character SHA is not a link in a release body.

## v0.1.0

The first public release. Everything is new, so the useful summary is what the project does and what
it does not promise.

### What it does

- **Sessions API** over gRPC: create, list, get, exec, replay, fork, suspend, resume.
- **Deterministic replay.** Reconstructing a session serves recorded model results from the journal
  and invokes the model zero times, so replay is exact and free.
- **Tamper-evident provenance.** Every record is hash-chained over RFC 8785 JCS, which is
  language-neutral: an independent Python verifier reproduces the Go hashes.
- **Fork.** Branch a session into children that each continue independently from one checkpoint.
- **Bring your own harness.** Implement two methods, in process or over the `Harness.Connect`
  stream.
- **Pluggable compute** through the `Runtime` SPI, with capability-gated placement across
  replay-based and memory-snapshot-based resumption.
- **Live streaming.** Output relays as the model produces it. Deltas are transport only: never
  logged, never hash-chained, never produced on replay.
- **Model access** for any endpoint speaking the chat-completions body, with no vendor SDK.

### Compatibility

`agentsessions.v1` is a proto namespace, not a stability promise. The Go module is pre-1.0 and makes
no backward-compatibility guarantee; the wire contract and the Go SPI may both change. From this
release onward, the schema is gated against the previous release and breaking changes are called out
here.

### Not provided

- No authentication, authorization, or transport security. `IdentityRef` is recorded as provenance
  and never enforced, and `project` is a filter rather than a tenancy boundary. A host is not safe
  to expose to an untrusted network or to treat as multi-tenant. See
  [`docs/security.md`](docs/security.md).
- `DeleteSession` and `Cancel` are declared in the contract and not implemented.
- Harnesses register at build time, so adding one means building a server.
- The full session history is passed to the harness on every turn, which does not scale to long
  sessions.
